```
* README.md: This file explains the concepts and a hands-on exercise to practice the concepts.
* solution: This directory contains setup.sh script to solve this particular level
* src: This directory contains the source code of the level. Specifically, it contains a C program named donut.c which outputs a flying donut.


We will use the wetty terminal to containerize the application.
